your system. Please follow [these instructions](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/installing-elixir-erlang-with-asdf) to install
the necessary plugins before installing Elixir.

Once you have `asdf` installed, you can install the necessary Erlang and Elixir versions by running the following commands in the project's root folder:

asdf install
```
